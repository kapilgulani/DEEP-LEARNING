# Symbol Detection Neural Network

This repository contains the development and evaluation of a neural network model aimed at symbol detection within communication systems. The focus is on optimizing the Bit Error Rate (BER) through different model configurations and training optimizations.

## Overview

The project evaluates main configurations:
- **Initial Model**: Utilizes a basic optimization approach for symbol detection.
- **Adam Optimized Model**: Incorporates the Adam optimizer for improved performance.

## Results

The comparative analysis between the initial and Adam optimized models reveals significant improvements with the adoption of Adam:

- **Initial Model (Epoch 20)**:
  - Training Loss: 0.5513
  - Validation Loss: 0.8324
  - Validation BER: 0.2160

- **Adam Optimized Model (Epoch 20)**:
  - Training Loss: 0.4536
  - Validation Loss: 0.4557
  - Validation BER: 0.1884

## Key Findings

- The **Adam optimizer** significantly enhances model performance, evident from reduced BER and loss metrics.
- **BER Improvement**: A reduction from 0.2160 to 0.1884, indicating a more accurate symbol detection capability.
- **Loss Metrics**: Show substantial improvements, highlighting better model generalization and efficiency in training.

## Conclusion

The analysis underscores the critical impact of optimizer selection on the effectiveness of neural network models in symbol detection tasks. The Adam optimizer's adaptive learning rate mechanism proves to be crucial in achieving lower BER and improved model generalization.
